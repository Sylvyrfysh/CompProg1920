In order to properly set up all of the resources, you must run `resources.bat`. This will set up all the resources in the location for each programming language.

## IntelliJ Setup for Java and Kotlin
In IntelliJ, go to `File > Open`. Navigate to the root folder, go to the jvm folder, and select CompProg1920 from it. IntelliJ will set up the Java and Kotlin projects, so you only have to create your own test files! Examples of how to do it are located at

- [Kotlin](jvm/CompProg1920/src/main/kotlin/example/CSAcademyOddDivisorsKt.kt)

Go ahead and create a PR! Whether it's new language support, a new problem set, same language with a new IDE, anything, create a PR! Make sure you:
- Allow us to push to your branch. Without this, we can't make changes we need to.
- State the purpose clearly and have a description. This lets us assess what your change intends to do.
- State anything you need us to do. Adding a new language/IDE might require extracting resources to a new place. We'll do our part to make your PR work.
