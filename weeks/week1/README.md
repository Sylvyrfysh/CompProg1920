# Week 1

### Plans:

1. Club Intro
 - Who Are We?
 - Goals
 - Competitions
2. Tools
 - Jetbrains Toolbox
 - GitHub Desktop
3. Get Set Up
 - Clone Repository
 - Get resources
 - Test Java/Kotlin solution
4. Split Out

#### People who know programming split:
1. 2 Problems
		5 minutes each. Let each person try to solve as much as possible
		The goal of this is to give people who have never done it a little window into the beginning- let them process info, see what they want to try

2. See who is in each grade so they can form a longer lasting team
3. 2-3 Problems
		Split into random groups of 3. Have them come together and solve
		5-10 minutes per. not for solving, more for finding people who they like working with
		What Worked?
		What was your approach?
		The goal of this is to find teams, and also let some ideas disperse. People might have had enough time or have done this before, and now have ideas that they'll share on approach

4. Last Problem- (NCNA 2018 D, 2017 I)
		Have people try a group of people they liked. Work through a problem
		See if solutions can be made.
		Start going through what works and why it works, what fails and why it does (data structures first, brute force, process at input time vs after a sort)


#### People who have largely not programmed before
1. Assess Knowledge
2. ?
3. Program Design fundamentals
